06-27-2015 @ 02:35:54Z [maddogkiller63] @leahloveschief well done getting 8-1 considering it's 3:30 am here just finished my trials runs all I can say is it's helpful having someone running in a different times one who's actually awake at this time
06-27-2015 @ 02:35:56Z [t3mpiirobin] the kinda people who send dick pics to people they dont know/have never spoken to
06-27-2015 @ 02:35:57Z [jimmydematteo] cool hair
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:00Z [cgauntlet] @Nova__Flare, she's playing warlock so... no
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:07Z [grimdae] Is trials of thorns actually hard?
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:11Z [k0pparberg] @Nova__flare she's a warlock so she's using the equivalent which is light beyond nemesis
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:16Z [grimdae] I thought its just elimination 
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:21Z [dexterfettster] its just a shame how normally this chat is so civilised but as soon as "bigger" streamers are playing with Leah, all the kiddies show up
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:33Z [wraathx] @grimdae with a good team no
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:33Z [leahsbeautifulhair] leah u got heyfever?

06-27-2015 @ 02:36:48Z [burntcheeto1233] Who is in the background saying stuff sounds like another game of trials
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:52Z [t3mpiirobin] this chat doesnt seem like the type to be like this normally at all
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:52Z [starlordmot] Got any Daft Punk?
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:53Z [k0pparberg] @Leahsbeautifulhair she has hair fever Kappa
06-27-2015 @ 02:36:59Z [grimdae] if she's a warlock does that mean she can passion harder?
06-27-2015 @ 02:37:05Z [simple_r] Hi Leah how are you?
06-27-2015 @ 02:37:07Z [devon103] What part of the UK are you from?
06-27-2015 @ 02:37:07Z [gaggwrs123] @leahloveschief, you should work on that warlock crest of alpha lupi Kappa
06-27-2015 @ 02:37:08Z [conskie] That's some sexy *** hair
06-27-2015 @ 02:37:13Z [leahsbeautifulhair] @K0pparberg im the fever she needs

06-27-2015 @ 02:37:43Z [jwic01] feel*
06-27-2015 @ 02:37:43Z [activequasar] @dexterfettster earlier today when the viewers where less in number (the number doesn't really count cuz I'm nice) chat was so nice.
06-27-2015 @ 02:37:58Z [asdfghjklqwerybsanibdochs] well she's awfully cute : )
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:01Z [dexterfettster] @leahsbeautifulhair but not the fever she wants? is that the line oh god im tires
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:07Z [k0pparberg] @T3mpiirobin it isn't but all the children from goths stream heard a girl and came to check her out to try and quench their thirst
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:08Z [mikeitisssz] hello leah :) 
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:12Z [grimdae] but trials of thorns is just elimination with level advantages which means if everyone is the same level it's fine right?
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:13Z [johnnybumpkins] I feel like Leah can surpass anything and is in the ZONE. Nothing as petty as sleep can distract her.
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:15Z [t3mpiirobin] @Activequasar it tends to happen like that, its really sad
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:16Z [ghostbanditj] leahWAT

06-27-2015 @ 02:38:29Z [cgauntlet] @Activequasar, yeah, it's great that she's got more viewers but it's nice when it's a bit quieter and more chill, also less creeps
06-27-2015 @ 02:38:29Z [efren661] Watch out Leah is in Super Sayen Mode leahHAIR

06-27-2015 @ 02:39:37Z [starlordmot] I think the most annoying part of being a streamer would be the same questions over and over again
06-27-2015 @ 02:39:38Z [johnnybumpkins] Is Rewtbot still in shambles?

06-27-2015 @ 02:42:23Z [surreptitiousllama] Trolling is a form of cowardice. It's easier than actually relating to someone.

06-27-2015 @ 02:43:17Z [jwic01] honestly, i think most of us who watch streams, is for the peopple, the streamer and the chat and that interaction, its a community. and those of us who have been bulied feel like we have a place here, a safe haven.
06-27-2015 @ 02:43:24Z [primebarricade] Would you lick my nose @leahloveschief
